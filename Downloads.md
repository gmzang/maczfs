# We have moved! #

MacZFS Downloads have been moved away from Google Code and can now be found at http://downloads.maczfs.org.

The move was necessary, because Google discontinued the binary download services for all Google code hosted project on Jan 15, 2014.  While old files remain accessible, it is no longer possible to create new downloads.  So we moved.

# MacZFS IRC Channel #

You can get X-Chat Aqua at http://sourceforge.net/projects/xchataqua/ or for instant browser-based chat, go to http://webchat.freenode.net/ and enter your desired nickname and the channel "#mac-zfs".  Put us in your client's auto-connect list.

There are always several
people idling there 24/7/365, and we'll read and respond eventually, if we're not active when you arrive.  So go ahead and talk.  Some of the most active people are dtm, JasonRM (of MacZFS and iPhone development fame), and VictorI (of Mac emulation fame).  We really look forward to interacting with more MacZFS fans!

Also on irc.freenode.net, there is #zfs for access to people with an even broader and more general
and more professional ZFS experience.  Beware of platform bigots who scorn anything other than Solaris and FreeBSD, or who belligerently believe that ZFS on MacOS magically does not and can not exist just because Apple dropped their version of it.  We're all in the same boat!

Standard IRC concepts definitely apply... don't ask to ask, don't poke
people to see if we're there because it's not a phone call or a customer service desk.  You're not a customer; you're one of us.  We're just a bunch of peers hanging out and making this stuff work.  Just go right ahead and say whatever you know and we'll all eventually chat!  We love having everyone.

So do come and stay connected.
